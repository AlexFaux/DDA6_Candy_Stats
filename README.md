# DDA6_Candy_Stats

Second and final PowerBI dashboard for our PowerBI week at NSS DDA6. 

I decided to use the data gathered by FiveThirtyEight here **https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/candy-power-ranking** involving a power ranking of different candies according to head to head matchups determined by viewers of the site.

I focused on the difference between the data of the chocolate candies and fruity candies.
